# rlox

I implemented the [monkey programming language](https://github.com/nilskch/monkeylang/) in Rust using the awesome book
"[Writing Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)", but this was my first ever Rust code and therefore
quite shitty. The monkey programming language is very simple and a great start to understand interpreters, but I wanted
to write an interpreter again with a better understanding of Rust and with more features and learn more theory in general.

The Lox programming language from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is much more feature-rich
and the book provides more theory (and is much thicker). This repo is my attempt to port the Lox programming language to
Rust and learn along the way.
